# Graphing Calculator (AOOD-GraphingCalculator-2024)
**A basic graphing calculator** <br>
Using the [graphers coded earlier](https://github.com/devsai9/AOOD-Graphing-2024), I made a simple graphing calculator app using Java Swing.

## Features
- A Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Graph normal, continuous functions
  - Format: `y=[function]`
  - e.g. `y=2x` or `y=x^2`
- Graph parametric grpahs
  - Format: `x=[function];y=[function];[lower bound]<t<[upper bound]`
  - e.g. `x=sin(t);y=cos(t);0<t<pi`
- Show/hide inputted equations in the visual grapher
- Change the color of graphed curves and lines

## What I learned/refined

2. Using Java Swing
3. Object-Oriented Programming
4. Unit Testing

## Technologies used
